* I work at 🪟 Microsoft as a Senior Researcher. I work on **making excellent developer tools for secure software engineering** and **developing next-generation agent systems for software engineering**.
* I was a research intern at 🪟 Microsoft during Summer 2023 and 2024 under [Alexey Svyatkovskiy]([https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/alsvyatk/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Oj4J4wAAAAJ)), [Michele Tufano](https://tufanomichele.com/), and [Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rozilouc/).
* I earned my PhD in Computer Science at 🐦 Iowa State University, working in the [Program Analysis & AI Lab (PAAL)](http://weile.work/lab.html) under [Dr. Wei Le](http://weile.work/).
* I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from 🐦 Iowa State University, studying under [Dr. Wei Le](http://weile.work/). See my thesis on refactoring as data augmentation [here](/publication/2021-12-19-msthesis).
* I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from 🐻 Bob Jones University.
* I have several years of software engineering experience with `C#/ASP.NET` and `Azure` stack, in the domains of 🧑‍🌾 precision agriculture at [Ag Leader](https://www.agleader.com/) and 📦 Amazon fulfillment center management at [Roney Innovations](https://www.roneyinnovations.com/).

# Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and software engineering. I think that the current methods for program analysis are limited by only relying on an analytical approach, and that they will be much improved by integrating probabilistic reasoning which can be achieved by training deep learning with big data.
